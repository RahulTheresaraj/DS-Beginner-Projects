# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The main goal is to understand how various factors influence house prices and evaluate the performance of a linear regression model in making these predictions.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which includes information about houses in various suburbs of Boston. Key features include the average number of rooms, the percentage of the lower status population, the pupil-teacher ratio, and more.

## Steps Performed
1. **Import the Libraries:**
   - Imported necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

2. **Data Loading:**
   - Loaded the Boston Housing dataset from a CSV file.
   - Displayed the first few rows to understand its structure.

3. **Data Exploration:**
   - Examined the dataset's structure and summary statistics.
   - Checked for missing values.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created pair plots to visualize relationships between the target variable (house prices) and key features.

5. **Data Preprocessing and Model Training:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Trained a linear regression model using the training set.
   - Made predictions on the test set.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
   - Visualized actual vs. predicted prices and the residuals distribution.

## Results
- **Mean Squared Error:** `mse`
- **R-squared:** `r2`

## Visualizations
- **Actual vs. Predicted Prices:** Scatter plot showing the relationship between actual and predicted prices.
- **Residuals Distribution:** Histogram showing the distribution of residuals (errors).

## Overall Results and Conclusion
Our linear regression model effectively predicted house prices with an MSE of `mse` and an R-squared value of `r2`. The model's performance can be further improved by experimenting with different models, feature engineering, and cross-validation.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with other regression models.
- Perform feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
